This is a recipe viewer just done as a demo for this blog:
TODO: Add link

It uses QueryAPI to connect to Neo4j, so the port to use is 7474 for http and 7473 for https. For example:
http://localhost:7474
or
https://xxxxxxxx.databases.neo4j.io:7473

**It is entirely generated by ChatGPT from this prompt:**

I have recipes stored in Neo4j as a graph. The recipe itself is a node called :Recipe with the following properties: name (string) description (string) servings (number) cookingTime (number): Estimated number of minutes to cook instructions (list of string): The cooking instructions

This node has one :Ingredient node for every ingredient (connected with [:INGREDIENT]). The ingredients has: name (string)

The :INGREDIENT relationships has one property called number (number) that tells how the ingredients should be sorted in the recipe.

Every :Ingredient node has a [:AMOUNT] relationship to a :Unit node :AMUNT has a property (amount) that tells how much of the ingredient to take of that unit :Unit has a property (name)

Can you give me a simple HTML (with embedded Javascript) as one file that connects to Neo4j with QueryAPI and shows a list of receipts in the database, and then renders the selected :Recipe in a nice human-readable way formatted as you would see recipes in a cook book.

Please do a nice visual design with a white background and dark blue accent color.
